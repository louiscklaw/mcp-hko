draft `run.js`, a nodejs script

1. iterate the `md` files in `/home/logic/_wsl_workspace/001_github_ws/mcp-ws/hko-mcp/documentation` directory
2. read the `done` flag in frontmatter, default to `false` if not found
3. create a markdown file `progress.md` and list the results

`- [ ] xxx.md <h1_here_please>`

---

please look into REQ_xxxx.md,

1. list all `documentations/REQ_xxxx/REQ_xxxx.md`.
2. look into every file, process it one by one,
3. no need to process markdown file with number below `0010`
4. draft and replace `makeFeltearthquakeRequest` with value from `h1` in frontmatter, for example `make<H1>Request`,
